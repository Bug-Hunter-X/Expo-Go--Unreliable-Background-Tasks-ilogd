While a complete fix within Expo Go itself isn't possible, a workaround involves using a more robust background task management library or service that's less reliant on the Expo Go environment's internal task handling.  This example uses a library (replace with your chosen library) that may offer more consistent behavior.  Consider also implementing more robust error handling and task recovery mechanisms within your background task code to improve overall reliability.  A standalone build should be used for production or applications requiring reliable background task functionality.
